# Best-Profit-for-Transportation
It's an example of use genetic algorithm for find out the most optimized routes for taxis or other kind of transportation.
# Okay , let's start 
Actually it was my course project and i've spend 2 days(if you've been a student you know it means two nights)
So, i've decided to continue with this stuff
Hope I will find time to improve and continue with it.
# High level description
It's excelent example how to use genetic algorithm
Here is example how to use it with transportation
Here are a lot of work with google maps and as i think not bad idea how to apply genetic alg on this problem
